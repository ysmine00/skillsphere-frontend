## Overview

SkillSphere is a database-driven web application originally developed as a capstone project for a Database Systems course. The frontend is a single-page React application that communicates with a RESTful Express API backed by PostgreSQL.

Key features:
- Register and log in with an AUI email (`@aui.ma`)
- Browse a marketplace of skill offerings and requests
- Create and manage your own offerings and requests
- Initiate, accept, and complete skill exchanges
- Track engagement through a personal activity score
- Manage your skill profile with proficiency levels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- The [SkillSphere backend](https://github.com/ysmine00/skillsphere-backend) running on port `5000`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ysmine00/skillsphere-frontend.git
cd skillsphere-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

> Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

If not set, the app defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## How Authentication Works

1. User registers or logs in — the backend validates credentials and returns a **JWT token**
2. The token is stored in `localStorage`
3. Every API call includes the token as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header, handled automatically by the Axios interceptor in `services/api.js`
4. If a token is missing or expired, the user is redirected to `/login`
5. `PrivateRoute.jsx` checks for a valid token before rendering any protected page

Only `@aui.ma` email addresses are accepted at registration, enforced on both the frontend and the database level.
